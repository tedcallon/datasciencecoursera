Feature Selection (taken from provided features_info.txt)
=================

The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

(the following is edited to fit the provided table of data):

For this group of estimated variables, two general measurements were kept:

mean(): Mean value
std(): Standard deviation

Then, using these measurements, the mean of each was taken. This is denoted in each column name in the provided table. One will notice that each measurement starts with "Mean_of_" to indicate that it is the mean of each measurement. Furthermore whether or not it is the mean of the mean of said measurement or mean of the standard deviation of the measurement is clear based on wehtehr the column name ends with std() or mean(). 

Means were taken of the measurements for each activity for each subjectID. Each row is thus defined by which activity and which subject it is averaging the measurements for, as indicated in the Activity and SubjectID rows (the first two columns in the dataset)
